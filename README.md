# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website — built to showcase my work, experience, and growth as a software developer.

Live Site: https://uditaved.netlify.app/

## About

This portfolio reflects my journey from learning frontend fundamentals to shipping production-ready features in a startup environment.

I built this site to keep things minimal, clean, and focused — just like how I approach building products.

## What It Highlights

- My experience at Nova Platform
- Key workflows and features I’ve shipped
- Technical skills and tools I work with
- A glimpse into how I think about building products

## Tech Stack

- React.js
- JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Next.js
- Netlify (deployment)

## Why This Project Matters

This site isn’t just a portfolio — it’s a snapshot of my current state as a builder.

As I grow in product thinking and engineering depth, this website evolves with me.
